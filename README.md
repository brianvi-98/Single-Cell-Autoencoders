# Single-Cell-Autoencoders
The run.py file is our main file, and running the test target on it will train the models as well as output the loss of the test data. 
To obtain the data, we used https://openproblems.bio/neurips_docs/data/dataset/ . But in our github we will work with a smaller dataset in order to test out our targets.
We have also uploaded a notebook which creates our visuals and also shows how to create our model and train it.
